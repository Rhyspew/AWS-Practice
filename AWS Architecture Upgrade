# Project inspired by Adrian Cantril course labs.

This project will take a simple Wordpress App and upgrade it to a highly available and secure architecture.
Services used:
EC2
RDS
Systems Manager: Session Manager
Systems Manager: Parameter Store
EFS
ALB
CloudWatch

Stage 1:
# Use ACantril CloudFormation stack to launch instance
- Once instance is running, manually configure via seeion manager connection. Use code from ACantril. 
- Configuration uses parameters stored in parameter store. Ensure reference is correct in script. 
- This part of the process provides experience in launching and configuring an app manually. 

Stage2:
# Create a pre-configured launch template to automate app launch
- Create a Launch template, ensure to input the configuration used in previous task

Stage 3:
# Migrate server on EC2 instance to RDS 
- Create a MariaDB RDS instance, configure the subnets and update parameters with new DBendpoint. 
- Update the launch template to launch the instance with only the wordpress application, add reference to read from the RDS instance. 

Stage 4:
# Create EFS storage so that the new instances can be launched using a common file storage
- Create an EFS storage. Arrange subnets and mount points.
- Update launch template to read from EFS

Stage 5:
# Create a way to automate instance health checks and instance recovery
- Create an ALB, Target group and Auto Scaling group using three availability zones to automate instance health and recovery. 
- Create a CloudWatch Alarm to monitor instance CPU usage to scale in and out based on demand
